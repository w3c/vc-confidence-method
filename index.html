This specification defines a mechanism that can be used with the
[[[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]] to increase a [=verifier|verifier's=] confidence about a
particular [=subject=] identified in a [=verifiable credential=].
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
This is an experimental specification and is undergoing regular revisions. It is
not fit for production deployment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
When a [=verifier=] performs the process of [=validate|validating=] a
[=verifiable credential=], it is useful to be able to raise the confidence level
that the [=subjects=] identified in a [=verifiable credential=] are the same
ones that interacted with the [=issuer=] when it performed its vetting process
to issue the [=verifiable credential=]. For example, when an employer (the
[=issuer=]) issues a corporate identification card to an employee (the
[=subject=]), it might require that the employee bind a particular cryptographic
key (<a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#verification-method">verification
method</a>) to the [=verifiable credential=] during the issuing process. In that
case, the [=issuer=] can use this specification to convey to the [=verifier=]
which cryptographic key was bound during the initial identity assurance process.
      </p>

      <p>
In other words, an [=issuer=] can use this specification to convey which
provable mechanisms it used to bind [=claims=] in a [=verifiable credential=] so
that a [=verifier=] can increase their confidence in the truth of a variety of
things, including the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
a particular identifier in the [=verifiable credential=] refers to the same
[=subject=] the issuer intended it to refer to,
        </li>
        <li>
a [=subject=], such as the [=presentation|presenter=] of a [=verifiable
credential=], is the same [=subject=] that the [=issuer=] made [=claims=] about,
        </li>
        <li>
a [=subject=] [=controller|controls=], or has been designated to use, one or
more mechanisms for demonstrating proof-of-possession of cryptographic key
material,
        </li>
        <li>
a [=subject=] identified in the [=verifiable credential=] can be checked against
a biometric.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
          <p>
Terminology used throughout this document is defined in the
<a data-cite="VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0#terminology">Terminology</a> section of the
[[[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]] and the [[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]] specification.
          </p>
      </section>
      <section id="conformance">
        <p>
A <dfn>conforming document</dfn> is any concrete expression of the data model
that follows the relevant normative requirements in Section
<a href="#data-model"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn>conforming processor</dfn> is any algorithm realized as software and/or
hardware that generates and/or consumes a [=conforming document=]. Conforming
processors MUST produce errors when non-conforming documents are consumed.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>
      <p>
This specification defines the `confidenceMethod` property for expressing
confidence method information in a `credentialSubject` in a [=verifiable
credential=].
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>confidenceMethod</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
        <dd>
          <p>
If present, the value of the `confidenceMethod` property is one or more
confidence methods. Each confidence method is bound to one or more [=subjects=]
in the [=verifiable credential=], and provides enough information for a
[=verifier=] to determine whether the [=holder=] can generate a [=verifiable
presentation=] to increase the [=verifier's=] confidence that they are the same
entity referenced by the confidence method. This is referred to as satisfying
the confidence method. It is required that the [=issuer=] verifies that the
[=holder=] can satisfy each `confidenceMethod` the [=issuer=] includes in the
[=claims=] of the [=verifiable credential=]s they issue.
          </p>
          <p>
Each confidence method MUST specify its `type` and MAY specify an `id`. The
precise properties and semantics of each confidence method are determined by the
specific `confidenceMethod` type definition.
          </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
A [=verifier=] can decide to accept [=claims=] in a [=verifiable credential=]
without requiring use of the confidence method, or use a different mechanism to
increase their confidence about whether, for example, the [=holder=] is the same
entity the issuer made [=claims=] about in the [=verifiable credential=]. Such a
decision can impact the [=verifier=]'s liability when accepting
[=verifiable credentials=] during certain use cases.
      </p>

      <p>
A [=verifier=] can validate that the [=holder=] controls, or has been designated
the ability to use, a confidence method by verifying the [=data integrity
proof|proof=] of the <a>verifiable presentation</a> using the information in the
confidence method. The confidence method can include the verification key, or
the type of the confidence method can define that the verification key is to be
inferred from other properties in the [=verifiable credential=], such as the
`credentialSubject.id`.
      </p>

      <p>
The following example demonstrates the various types of confidence methods
that can be used, including public cryptographic keys, verification methods,
and Decentralized Identifier Documents.

      <p class="note">
A confidence method can express various metadata such as the [=issuer=]'s level
of confidence that the [=holder=] is the [=subject=] of the [=verifiable
credential=], specific form factors or mechanisms of authenticators, and/or
references to other [=verifiable credentials=] or versioned trust frameworks.
For example, an [=issuer=] can make a [=claim=] about a confidence method that
is based on a cryptographic key pair, but to produce a signature using that key,
the [=holder=] has to unlock a device using multi-factor authentication.

Add security considerations section that includes at least the following topics:
        <ul>
          <li>
Since confidence methods can be selectively disclosed, verifiers need to
explicitly ask for confidence methods in high-assurance use cases when
dealing with proof mechanisms that allow for selective or unlinkable disclosure.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <div class="issue" title="Add Privacy Considerations section">
Add privacy considerations section that includes at least the following topics:
        <ul>
          <li>
Confidence methods are expected to be selectively disclosed, as they might not
be necessary in many low-assurance use cases, or where high-assurance is
achieved through a different means such as in-person verification against a
photo.
          </li>
          <li>
If a confidence method is unlinkably disclosed, it can reveal
correlatable identifiers, such as public cryptographic key identifiers.
          </li>
          <li>
Strongly advise against using biometrics for confidence methods unless
absolutely required. Warn that verifiers should only require biometric photos
as a last resort and should destroy the information after the transaction
is complete.
